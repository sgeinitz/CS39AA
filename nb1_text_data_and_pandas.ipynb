Simply splitting a tweet into tokens with the 'SPACE' character as a delimiter means that positive tokens like _\"awesome.\"_ and _\"awesome!\"_ are considered as two different tokens. Cases such as that one are relatively easy to solve since it just meaning removing some punctuation. However, different forms of a word, such as _\"delay\"_ and _\"delayed\"_ can cause some issues too. For our ad hoc modeling approach above, resolving these tokenization don't seem to affect the outcome too much right now. But, once we try to use a proper model (e.g. naive bayes, neural network, etc.), then these tokenization deficiences can affect model performance even more. For example, having all of the different forms of the verb _\"delay\"_ will mean that our model needs to have that many more parameters in it. \n","2. __Vectorization__: Even with better tokenization, we still need to do more modify the data to be able to use other types of models. What we specifically need to do is convert the tokens into a numerical representation of some kind. When working text data, this process of converting text/tokens into a numerical representation will allow us to use many different types of models, including neural networks. \n","3. __Modeling Process/Evaluation:__ The modeling process and assessment need to be improved. To start, our accuracy of {{mod_accuracy}} is not much better than if we simply label every tweet as negative (since 65% of all tweets are negative). So we need to be sure that we're comparing our model performance metrics to a suitable baseline. The larger issue, however, is that we don't have a validation and/or test set right now. We used all 10k observations to build our positive, negative, and neutral sets of words; then we check our accuracy on these exact same sets of tweets. To really understand how our model will work for a new tweet that we have never seen, and that is posted in the future, we need to remove a portion of the dataset from the 'training', then evaluate our model against this. \n","\n","We'll come back to this dataset in one or notebooks and address these, but for now try to think about what impact they are having and how best we can resolve them. \n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.12 ('base')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"orig_nbformat":4,"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"bb3398f4b21c7b026dd5874af3f954bf25f1e8ff81e25d82a94abcbbaacf760b"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
